## Description

This is a React application that is designed to help restaurants find charities that are in need of food donations. Restaurants are consistently struggling with having to throw out leftover food at the end of every day, which is where our app comes in handy. Users will be able to not only find locations that are in need of donations but also schedule deliveries to transport the donations to the desired location.
